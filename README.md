# Cycling Landing Page

## Overview

A basic product landing page built with HTML and CSS that implements responsive design standards.

## Description

This is a very simple landing page built with custom HTML and CSS. It contains mostly placeholder content. An interesting lesson I learned through creating this page was figuring out how to get a YouTube video to autoplay successfully in a Chrome browser. I can definitely see that being useful in other projects as well.
